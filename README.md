# Final-Project

Topic: Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

As many industries are becoming more and more competitive, many companies are actually making use of big data to relocate resources and to maximize profit by providing goods and services that are valued most by most customers. This is not an exception for the airline industry. In this project, a passenger satisfaction data set is provided by an airline company. I will investigate the associations between different rated/recorded factors and passenger’s satisfaction, and will come up with a model that recommends the top 3 and least 3 factors this airline company should focus on when relocating their resources.
